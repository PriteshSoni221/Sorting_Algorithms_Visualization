# Sorting_Algorithms_Visualization
Main.py is the file you may want to execute. I am trying to make the graph in the canvas responsive as well so that file is in canvas_experiment.py . I am planning to implement 5 sorting algorithms but that may change in the future. (Hopefully the number will increase!).
Note! Please change the path of the background image before running the Main.py . I like to use full path in my programs so it may trigger some error in your computer.
